# Netlify Secrets Scanning Fix - Deployment Guide

## Problem Solved âœ…

The Netlify build was failing due to secrets scanning detecting Stripe price IDs in the build output. This has been resolved with the following changes:

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `netlify.toml`
- Added `SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS` configuration to allow Stripe price IDs in build output
- These variables are safe to expose publicly as they're designed for client-side use

### 2. Optimized `vite.config.ts`
- Improved chunk splitting to reduce bundle size warnings
- Added manual chunks for better performance
- Increased chunk size warning limit to 1000kb

### 3. Enhanced `src/config/stripe.ts`
- Added configuration validation
- Improved error handling
- Added clear documentation about price ID safety

### 4. Updated `env.example`
- Added all required Stripe price ID environment variables
- Clear documentation about which variables are safe to expose

## Why This Solution Works

**Stripe Price IDs are Safe to Expose Publicly:**
- Stripe price IDs (like `price_1234567890`) are designed to be used in client-side code
- They don't contain sensitive information - they're just identifiers for pricing plans
- Stripe's security model relies on server-side validation using secret keys
- The actual payment processing happens server-side in Netlify Functions

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Netlify
Go to your Netlify dashboard â†’ Site settings â†’ Environment variables and add:

```
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_key
VITE_STRIPE_PRICE_BEGINNER=price_your_beginner_id
VITE_STRIPE_PRICE_PRO=price_your_pro_id
VITE_STRIPE_PRICE_MAX=price_your_max_id
VITE_STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_YEARLY=price_your_pro_yearly_id
VITE_STRIPE_PRICE_MAX_YEARLY=price_your_max_yearly_id
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret
```

### 2. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Netlify secrets scanning for Stripe price IDs"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Trigger New Build
- The build will automatically trigger on push
- Or manually trigger from Netlify dashboard

## Verification

After deployment, verify:
1. âœ… Build completes successfully without secrets scanning errors
2. âœ… Stripe payment integration works correctly
3. âœ… Video analysis features remain functional
4. âœ… All subscription plans are accessible

## Security Notes

- **Safe to Expose**: Stripe price IDs, publishable keys
- **Never Expose**: Secret keys, webhook secrets, API keys
- **Current Setup**: Secret keys are only used in Netlify Functions (server-side)

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are set in Netlify
2. **Verify Price IDs**: Make sure Stripe price IDs are valid and active
3. **Check Function Logs**: Review Netlify Function logs for any server-side errors
4. **Test Locally**: Run `npm run build` locally to verify the build process

## Performance Improvements

The updated Vite configuration now:
- Splits code into smaller chunks for better loading performance
- Reduces bundle size warnings
- Improves caching efficiency

Your video analysis application should now deploy successfully on Netlify! ðŸš€
